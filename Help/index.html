        <h1>RegexForAccordance</h1>
        
        <p>Search Bible texts in <a href="http://www.accordancebible.com">Accordance</a> with regular expressions.</p>
        
        <h2>System Requirements</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Mac OSX 10.9 or later</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.accordancebible.com">Accordance</a> 10.4.5 or later</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        
        <p>Choose a text module name and enter a verse Range, like "Gen-Mal". Set the search options and the filter options. In the search field, enter a regular expression, and then press return to start searching.</p>
        
        <p>The text is searched line-by-line, one verse per line.  Matches do not span verses. </p>
        
        <p>The regular expression matching uses <a href="http://userguide.icu-project.org/strings/regexp">ICU Regular Expression</a> syntax, provided by Apple.<p>
        
        <h2>Combining Marks and Composite Characters</h2>
        
        <p>Combining marks are treated as separate characters.  For example, Bet with Dagesh (בּ) counts as two characters. Likewise, Iota with an accent (ί) counts as two characters. Use filters to remove Hebrew cantillation and points or Greek diacritics if you want to search for unadorned letters only.</p>
        
        <h2>Accordance Preferences</h2>
        
        <p>Accordance has a few settings in Preferences that affect the format of the text that it sends to RegexForAccordance.</p>
        
        <p><b>Appearance > Use European verse notation</b> If checked, a comma separates chapter and verse, and a period separates a list of verses: Gen 1,1.3-4.  If unchecked, a colon separates chapter and verse, and a comma separates a list of verses: Gen 1:1,3-4.</p>
        
        <p><b>Appearance > Use SBL standard abbreviations</b> If checked, book names are abbreviated without a period, and a space separates the book number from the book name: 1 Sam 4:7. If unchecked, a period ends most book names, and there is no space between the book number and the book name: 1Sam. 4:7.</p>
        
        <p><b>Citation > Suppress poetry</b>  If checked, every line will be a complete verse. If unchecked, some verses will contain multiple lines and tab characters.</p>
        
        <h2>The Search Window</h2>
        
        <h3>Entering a Range</h3>
        
        <p>For the Range, a single book name will do (Gen), or a range of books (Gen-Rev), or specific verses (Gen 1:1-2:7).</p>
        
        <h3>Filters</h3>
        
        <p>Filters modify the text before the line is searched. Use filters to remove spaces, pointing, diacritics, etc. Click the Filters… button to show the options.</p>
        
        <h3>Search Options</h3>
        
        <p>If Ignore Case is selected, the search will not be case-sensitive. If Include References is selected, then the verse reference will be part of the search string.</p>
        
        <p>With Include References turned off, the search string for Gen 1:1 is "¶ In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. ".
        <br/>With Include References turned on, the search string for Gen 1:1 is "Gen 1:1 ¶ In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. ".</p>
        
        <p>In either case, the verse reference will be shown in the search results.</p>
        
        <h3>Left-to-Right Override</h3>
        
        <p>Mixing right-to-left Hebrew characters with regular expression syntax can be confusing.  Use Left-to-Right Override to show the Hebrew letters in reverse order so that you can see their logical relationship with the rest of the regular expression. Although the characters are displayed in reverse order, they will still match the text in their normal right-to-left order.</p>
        
        <p>The button to the left of the search field toggles Left-to-Right Override. This is also in the Edit menu.</p>
        
        <p>Left-to-Right Override off: <code>\bאבר\w+</code> matches אברהם.</p>
        
        <p>Left-to-Right Override on: <code>&#x202D;\bאבר\w+&#x202C;</code> matches אברהם.  With the Hebrew characters shown in reverse order, we can see that the word boundary (\b) is followed by Aleph (א), and it will match one or more word-characters (\w+) that follow Resh (ר).</p>
        
        <h3>Linking Back to Accordance</h3>
        
        <p>There are several different links to Accordance.</p>
        <ul><li>Hyperlinks on the individual verse references</li>
            <li>A link button above the search results</li>
            <li>A link button next to each distinct hit in the statistics table</li>
            </ul>
        
        <p>To avoid crashing Accordance, the link buttons may produce a popup menu if the verse lists are very long.</p>
        
        <h3>Statistics Table</h3>
        
        <p>Right click the column headers to add or remove columns in the statistics table.</p>
        
        <p>If you select a row in the statistics table, you can use ⌘G and ⇧⌘G (Edit > Find > Find Next/Find Previous) to highlight the matching hits in the search results area. You can also copy and paste these rows into another application.</a>
        
        <h2>Documents</h2>
        
        <p>The search window can be saved and loaded as a document.  The document contains all of the search settings in the window, but not the search results.  Run the search again to restore the search results.</p>
