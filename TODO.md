# Bugs

* When using a large font size, baselines within statistics table rows are not aligned.


# Feature Ideas

* The last column header (tableView.cornerView) can be a selector button, showing popup for show/hide column.

* Highlight or filter the search results when selecting a row in statistics.

* Group by chapter or verse

* Custom filters


# Font Problems

* Dotted Circle placeholder is misaligned with the combining marks in some fonts.  SBL Hebrew is best.

* When LRO is on, Hebrew points are misplaced when using system font in the search field.  The points stay on the correct characters when using SBL Hebrew (Edit > Search field font > Hebrew).
