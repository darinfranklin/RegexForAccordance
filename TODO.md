# TODO

* Screenshots and description

* Put on GitHub

* Create GitHub Pages


# Bugs

* The statistics table would look nicer if the baselines were aligned when using a large font size.


# Feature Ideas

* Option to span lines. Search an entire chapter or book as one string.

* The last column header (tableView.cornerView) can be a selector button, showing popup for show/hide column.

* Highlight or filter the search results when selecting a row in statistics.

* Group by chapter or verse

* Custom filters


# Font Problems

* Dotted Circle placeholder is misaligned with combiner in some fonts.  SBL Hebrew is best.

* Hebrew points are misplaced in the search field when LRO is on.  Maybe the formatter should precompose the characters as they are entered.
